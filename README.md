# Linear-Regression
Leveraging Linear Algebra for Sales Forecasting in Retail Businesses
# 🛍️ Retail Sales Prediction

This project analyzes historical sales data from a retail company using SQL and Python. The goal is to predict future sales amounts using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, based on features like product sales count, marketing expenditure, sale month, and geographic region.
